Calcineurin, a serine/threonine protein phosphatase, is activated by calcium and calmodulin after intracellular calcium levels are elevated for a sustained period of time. Activated calcineurin dephosphorylates several substrates, including the NFAT transcription factors, which then translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and activate a tissue-specific set of genes. In muscle, this set of genes includes MCIP-1, the protein product of which inhibits calcineurin, resulting in a negative feedback loop.

(A) TGF-mediated smooth muscle differentiation as measured by flow cytometry. Approximately 18,000 NCSCs per well isolated from sciatic nerve were transduced with the pMIG retroviral vector, and 2 d later 20 pM TGF-\u03b21 was added to half of the wells. After four additional days, the cells were fixed and stained with a primary antibody directed against SMA and a PE-conjugated secondary antibody, and PE and GFP fluorescence were determined by flow cytometry. The horizontal and vertical lines on each plot denote the upper boundary of GFP-negative and SMA-negative NCSCs, respectively. Cells to the right of the vertical line are GFP-positive and thus successfully transduced, and cells above the horizontal line are SMA-positive and thus are SMCs. The percentage of cells in each quadrant is indicated. Increased SMC content is evident in wells treated with TGF. (B) Calcineurin expression increases the percentage of SMCs in NCSC cultures, and inhibitors of calcineurin activity decrease the percentage of SMCs in NCSC cultures.

(C) A schematic model for LKB1 and SIK3 function to regulate lipid homeostasis in Drosophila fat body. LKB1 regulates the nucleocytoplasmic localization of HDAC4 via SIK3-dependent phosphorylation. Under feeding condition, DILPs-induced Akt activation leads to SIK3 activation, thereby inhibiting HDAC4 activity by phosphorylation. Under short-term fasting conditions, the AKH pathway inhibits the kinase activity of LKB1 in phosphorylating SIK3 Thr196 residue and controls SIK3 activity via PKA-dependent phosphorylation. Unphosphorylated and nuclear localized HDAC4 deacetylates and activates FOXO to increase bmm expression [19], thereby reducing lipid storage.

Shown are the mean \u00b1 SD values of three technical replicates from one representative experiment of two biological replicates performed. (B) H4 acetylation levels for several common Tip60/Hdac6 target genes in Tip60 KD and Hdac6 KD ESCs were measured by ChIP-qPCR, using an antibody specific for tetra-acetylated histone H4. H4 acetylation levels in cells knocked down as indicated are expressed as a fraction of the input. Shown are the mean \u00b1 SD values of three technical replicates from one representative experiment of two biological replicates performed. (C) ESCs were treated overnight with the indicated amounts of TubA in their growth medium, Tip60-H3F was immunoprecipitated as above, and co-immunoprecipitating proteins were examined by Western blotting. (D) Tip60-H3F was immunoprecipitated from ESCs grown under normal conditions, and the beads were washed in buffer with or without TubA. The Hdac6 eluted in the TubA wash or remaining bound to beads is shown by Western blotting, along with canonical Tip60 subunit Dmap1. (E) HA-tagged wild type, deacetylase domain 1 (HD1) mutant, or double deacetylase domain mutant (HD1 + HD2) Hdac6 was stably expressed in Tip60-H3F ESCs, Tip60-H3F was immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts, and co-precipitating proteins were examined by Western blotting.

On the opposite, in low glucose (1 mM) condition and after 24 h, the autophagic flux is activated via the AMPK/RAPTOR/mTOR pathway. Moreover, low glucose decreases BCL-XL protein expression, which freeing BAX and leads to apoptosis. Direct implication of BCL-2 family proteins in autophagy was not described in this study (dotted lines), but has been described in literature as modulator of free BECLIN1. Longer exposition to low glucose (48 h) induced a decrease in BCL-2 protein expression, which enhanced the effect on BAX (and possibly on BECLIN1). In parallel low glucose induces a decrease in LAMP2 expression, which impaired the autophagosomes/lysosomes fusion process that normally ends autophagy. Inhibition of elongation/maturation process, either chemically (3-MA) or genetically (ATG5/ATG7 KD) led to apoptosis via an increase of Caspase 3. Low glucose.

The BRAF kinase domain has two subdomains, a small N-terminal lobe and a large C-terminal lobe. The small lobe contains the nucleotide-binding pocket and the phosphate-binding loop, while the large lobe binds the proteins substrates and contains the catalytic loop. The two lobes are spatially connected through the activation segment (AS) of the large lobe. Sequentially, the N- and C-terminal lobes are connected by the hinge, and the AS is part of the C-lobe that interacts with the N-lobe. Movement of the two lobes relative to each other opens and closes the cleft. (B) The hydrophobic pocket around amino acid Val600 represented using the backbone and side chain view. Backbone residues are colored according to their location in the protein (see Figure 1A). Specifically, Leu597, Ala598, Val600, and Trp604 of the AS together with, Phe468, Leu525, Leu485, Val487, Phe498, and Ala497 of the N-terminal subdomain build the hydrophobic pocket.

(B) Proposed model for the role of \u03b3H2AX in the Chk1 suppressed death pathway responding to DNA replication stress. ATR-mediated Chk1 activation is crucial to maintain cell viability and genome stability upon replication stress, by regulating fork integrity, replication restart, and inappropriate origin firing in response to replication inhibitors (RIs, left). In the absence of Chk1, the action of Cdc45 on origin firing and helicase unwinding increases the level ssDNA in cells, triggering a caspase-3\u2013dependent apoptotic pathway in S-phase cells (middle). The data presented here suggest that \u03b3H2AX formation is enhanced in Chk1-depleted cells in response to persistent stress at DNA replication forks that also leads to prolonged ATM and Chk2 activation. The accumulation of \u03b3H2AX is also dependent on Cdc45, but the signal triggering H2AX phosphorylation is not clear (right). Our results suggest that \u03b3H2AX may help protect some cells from apoptosis, perhaps through maintaining S-phase checkpoints.

A splice-blocking beclin 1 MO was designed to overlap the intron-exon boundary at the 5\u2032-splice junction of exon 4 in the zebrafish beclin 1 gene. To detect aberrantly spliced RNA products, two forward primers were designed for exon 3 (EX3 primer) and exon 4 (EX4 primer), and one reverse primer was designed for exon 7 (EX7 primer) within the beclin 1 gene. The zebrafish beclin 1 gene has a total of 11 exons having three unique domains [BH3 domain, coiled-coil (CCD) domain, and evolutionarily conserved (ECD) domain], and the beclin 1 MO was anticipated to disrupt the BH3 domain encoded by exon 4 and exon 5. (B) Splicing detection of zbeclin 1 mRNA by RT-PCR. Amplified PCR fragments show the intact sizes of the two amplicons for EX3-EX7 and EX4-EX7 following control (water) injection or only spns1 MO injection. Either beclin 1 MO (12 ng/embryo) injection or coinjection of spns1 MO (4 ng/embryo) and beclin 1 MO (12 ng/embryo) generated a skipping of exon 4 (beclin 1\u0394exon4). This was detected by the presence of an altered EX3-EX7 amplicon and undetectable EX4-EX7 product. The deletion of exon 4 was confirmed by sequencing. Injected embryos were harvested for total RNA isolation at 54 hpf. (C and D) Rescue of the spns1 morphant by beclin 1 knockdown. (C) The yolk opaqueness phenotype appearance in control-injected (water), spns1 MO-injected, and spns1 and beclin 1 MOs-coinjected embryos was followed through 72 hpf. At 24 hpf, opaqueness commenced from the yolk extension region, which had almost disappeared or was severely damaged (more than 95% of spns1 MO-injected animals) with an extension of opacity to the entire yolk at 48 hpf. By 72 hpf, yolk opaqueness became highly dense throughout most of the spns1 MO-injected embryos, which usually died within another 24 h. Scale bar, 250 \u00b5m.

BafA can decelerate \u2018lysosomal biogenesis\u2019, which subsequently presumably prevents autophagosome-lysosome fusion, through the inhibition of the v-ATPase, and contributes to amelioration of the Spns1 defect at least temporarily. Basal p53 activity may suppress the intersection between the \u2018autophagic progress\u2019 and \u2018lysosomal biogenesis\u2019 where the Beclin 1 depletion was not sufficient, but the v-ATPase inhibition was still effective enough, to compete with the p53 loss to suppress the Spns1 deficiency. By switching the basal p53 state to the activated version with UV irradiation, p53 can promote autophagy. Spns1 might be a gatekeeper of autolysosomal maturation followed by lysosomal biogenesis. It remains unknown how p53 can mechanistically be linked to the lysosomal \u2018efflux\u2019 function of Spns1 as well as the lysosomal \u2018influx\u2019 function of v-ATPase, and further investigations will be required to explore this connection. (B) Roles of Spns1, p53 and Beclin 1 in senescence equilibrium. Loss of Spns1 leads to an imbalance in homeostasis and increased senescence. This effect can be ameliorated by concurrent knockdown of Beclin 1. p53 has a comparatively less dramatic impact on Spns1-loss-induced embryonic senescence. When in the \u201cbasal\u201d state, p53 helps retain equilibrium. When p53 is \u201cactivated\u201d by UV irradiation, a modest increase in senescence is observed. The higher level of senescence is seen during loss of Spns1 in the absence of basal p53 or in the presence of activated p53. During loss/knockdown of all three genes (spns1, p53 and beclin 1), a state of moderate senescence is observed.

This is instantly followed by receptor phosphorylation by GRK, which results in beta arrestin binding (arresting further G protein binding/signaling). Our findings suggest that alpha and beta arrestins heteroassociate and have coordinated functions. Among the biological functions that could be regulated by integrated alpha/beta arrestin functions are endocytic trafficking of cell surface cargoes (recycling or lysosomal degradation), kinase signaling (e.g., metabolism, cell growth, survival/apoptosis) and cytoskeletal dynamics. Alpha and beta arrestins could have a yin yang relationship with both antagonistic (e.g., inactivating and activating, respectively) and cooperative properties depending on context. We envision that arrestins are dynamic adaptors that can integrate internal and external information to mediate programmed ends (i.e., programs created through evolutionary processes).
